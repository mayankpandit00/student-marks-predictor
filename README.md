# Student Marks Predictor
A model that predicts the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

## About 
Education is very important issue regarding development of a country. The main objective of educational institutions is to provide high quality education to its students. One way to accomplish this is by predicting student's academic performance and thereby taking early steps to improve student's performance and teaching quality.

This system aims to predict student's marks using linear regression. The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.

Through this project we can determine:

- How many hours need to do the study to get certain marks.
- If one does X study of hours per day so how much marks one will get.

Through these points the school can determine the performance of the student.

To implement this model we are using Jupyter Notebook which is an open web source application.
